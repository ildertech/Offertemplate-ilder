\section{Introduction}
This document proposes an estimate for two phases of development related to \customername IT-infrastructure, data gathering and analysis capabilities.


\subsection{Background}
Currently \customername experiences a manually driven, problematic and inaccurate invoicing. \customername has a desire to automate most of this process as well as prepare for providing a modern and scalable user experience to its end customers as well as internal users working with \customername shore power systems within a wide range of fields.

The users listed below need varying degree of access to slices of data to use (via direct API access or a user interface), maintain and monitor data from the shore power systems. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Customer (ships)
\item Shipping companies
\item Maintenance personnel
\item Harbour personnel
\item Finance
\item Analytics and prospecting
\item Administrators
\item Developers
\item Third party shore power suppliers
\end{itemize}

The estimate is structured to start solving the most pressing needs defined by \customername.
