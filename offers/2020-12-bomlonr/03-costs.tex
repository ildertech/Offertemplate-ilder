\subsection{Payment}

We record hours spent and will invoice each month until the roof of 150K NOK is reached. Beyond that we will provide in-kind hours alongside the project, as well as a reasonable amount of in-kind work to make sure the MVP is satisfactory.

All invoices are issued beginning each month with a due date of 14 days. 

The invoice for yearly costs follows after release of MVP in march 2021.
