\section{Work covered by SLA}
This section will list various named services familiar to GroupM, type of regular work, as well as a service description.

Some of these services are not in our complete control and depend on first party and second party developers within and outside GroupM. We aim for 98 percent or more uptime, but in these cases downtime might be outside our control.

The scope of this agreement is limited to ensuring uptime, fixing of bugs, minor improvements and other small tasks deemed necessary as part of maintenance. This does not include larger pieces of work, such as development of new features.
